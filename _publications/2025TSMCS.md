excerpt: 'This paper proposed a Knowledge-guided Multi-View Memetic Algorithm for Flexible Welding Shop Scheduling with Finite Workers. The KMA considers that copy the information from critical path of global best solution can enhance convergece. A factor is adopted to control the rate of utilizing knowledge or randomness to balance convergence and diversity. Due to the constraints of machine and worker, a local search utilizing both worker and machine views gantt chart is proposed.'
